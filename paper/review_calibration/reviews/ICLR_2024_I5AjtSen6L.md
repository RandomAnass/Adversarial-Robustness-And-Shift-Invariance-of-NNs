**summary:**

The paper aims to certify the fairness of GNN models. The authors specify an indicator function that returns 1 when a given fairness metric (e.g. SP or EO) is below a treshold. This essentially reduces the problem to certifying a generic binary function, a problem that can be tackled with existing randomized smoothing certificates. They adopt the randomized smoothing framework and consider perturbations w.r.t. both the node attributes ($l_2$ norm) and the graph structure ($l_0$ norm) using Gaussian and Bernoulli noise respectively.

**strengths:**

In my opinion the main contribution of the paper is the introduction of the novel and highly relevant problem of certifying the fairness of GNNs. 

Considering the joint perturbation of both continious attributes and discrete structure is relevant and novel.

**weaknesses:**

One of the biggest weaknesses of the paper is that it does not properly place its results in the context of the existing literature. Once the indicator function w.r.t. the threshold has been defined the problem of certifying the output of the resulting function $g$ is a trivial application of previous results. The result from Theorem 1 has been know since 2019, since Theorem 1 (specifically Eq. 3) in [1] directly applies. However, the authors spend considerable effort re-proving these known results (e.g. via the intermediate Lemmas A1, A2 and A3 which are also known). Similarly, the results from Theorem 2 and Theorem 3 are already known, see [2] and the generalization in [3].

The paper also ignores the existence of collective certificates (see e.g. [4] and follow up work). Since for such collective certificates the predictions of all nodes are simultaneously certified this automatically implies a certificate on any function of those predictions and in particular any fairness metric. Therefore, a comparison with collective certificates is warranted. 

As a minor point: While the authors are the first to consider certficates w.r.t. both features and structure when the features are continious, joint certificates for discrete features have already been studuied in [3]. Moreover, the certificate in [3] is provably tight, while there is no such proof for the joint certificate presented in this paper. In addition, the presented joint certificate depends on the order: whether the features or the structure is certified first. Since the examined datatset can easily be modeled with discrete features (or at least approximated with a large number of categories) a reasonable baseline would be to use the joint certificate from [3] -- now applied to certify the function $g$ rather than the underlying classifier.

As a minor point: The authors claim that there is a high computational cost of calculating $\epsilon_A$. While the cost is higher compared to Gaussian smoothing it is definitely not prohibitevely high since as shown by [3] the certificate can be computed in linear time w.r.t. the certified radius, and thus the maximum certified redius can be also efficiently computed.

In addition to the above I have strong doubts in the correctness of Proposition 1 and the discussion in the preceeding "Obtaining Fair Classification Result" paragraph. Namely, the only thing that the randomized smoothing certificate asserts is that the output of the smoothed $g$ is the same for an observed input and any perturbation withing the certified radius. However, it does not imply that any particular $n$ dimensional output (for each of the $n$ test nodes) is certified. This is the same reason why we cannot simply certify a function $h = I$(accuracy of all nodes > threshold) and we need dedicated collective certificates as in [3] which certifies the collective prediction of all nodes. I'm happy to be proven wrong and reconsider if the authors provide a more in depth explanation. Note, that it is also not valid to consider the average vector of predictions. This also highlihts another big weakness -- certifying g is informative but any particular vector of predictions (for each test node) is not cerified, so in practice it's not clear which prediction the model should return.

Moreover, it seems that the guarantee in Proposition 1 only applies to perturbations w.r.t. the features since the authors take the best (smallest) value over all structure perturbation. If this is the case this should be clearly mentioned, if this is not the case it is not clear at all why the certificate holds when selecting the argmin as proposed.

Another weakness is the evaluation. While the 3 datasets (German Credit, Recidivism, Credit Defaulter) are often used in the fairness literature they are not ideal since the graph structure is not given but derived from the features (see NIFTY (Agarwal et al., 2021)). This means that there is a high correlation between the features and the structure and the redunancy in information leads to overly optimistic results. The two Pokec datasets which are also often used in the fairness literature would be more suitable.

Since every entry is flipped with the same probability $1-\beta$ even for very small values of $1-\beta$ we will introduced many new ones in the adjacency matrix destroying the sparsity which makes scaling to larger graphs more difficult.

Finally, I think the motivation behind the Fairness Certification Rate (FCR) metric is questionable. A more informative metric would be e.g. the largest certified threshold $\eta$ for different bugets.

1. Assuming that only the features are perturbed which final vector of test predictions is returned and why exactly is this vector certified?

**summary:**

This paper presents a fairness defense framework for certain attacks (adding Gaussian noise to certain nodal attributes and adding/deleting edges in adjacency), ELEGANT, which guarantees node label predictions that achieve a certain level of fairness with high probabilities under certain perturbation budgets. The perturbation budget on the adjacency for a given fairness level is computed by formulating an optimization problem.

**strengths:**

- Paper is fluent.
- Certification of fairness is an important and novel problem, which is considered by the paper.
- This work systematically builds an optimization framework and solves it to find the corruption budget on the adjacency matrix for a certain level of fairness.

**weaknesses:**

- I could not follow how the proposed scheme can be used to certify fairness metrics requiring the ground-truth label information (e.g., equal opportunity) over the test set. The paper claims that equal opportunity is a metric for which they can provide verification.
- The bias mitigation part of ELEGANT stems from the data augmentations (applied as attacks), as the Authors also mentioned in their paper. By applying multiple augmentations during the Monte Carlo process, they just blindly find the ones that help with algorithmic bias (which is costly). There are already existing works searching over such augmentations for bias mitigation [1, 2, 3], which utilize theoretical findings and systematic designs to automatize augmentation designs. Thus, the bias mitigation part of this work is not of sufficient contribution (Figure 2 would be fairer, if fairness-aware methods' results are obtained over the same set of corrupted graphs used for ELEGANT).
- While the initial research problem is an interesting and important one, to the best of my understanding, this paper applies well-known corruptions to the input graphs multiple times and utilizes Monte Carlo to estimate if the predictions achieve a certain level of fairness. The proposed approach is computationally costly, and lacks an inventive approach.

**questions:**

- How can one utilize ELEGANT for fairness certification for a fairness metric requiring the ground-truth labels (like equal opportunity)?
- Can you additionally provide the results for fairness-aware baselines over the same corrupted graphs as ELEGANT uses for the results in Figure 2? Accordingly, I suggest re-framing the discussion about bias mitigation in the paper.

**summary:**

The paper proposes a novel framework for certifying the fairness of graph neural networks (GNNs), which are models that can learn from graph-structured data. The framework, called ELEGANT, aims to protect the GNNs from malicious attacks that can corrupt the fairness of their predictions by adding perturbations to the input graph data. The framework uses a theoretical analysis to certify that the GNNs are robust to certain perturbation budgets, such that the attackers cannot degrade the fairness level within those budgets. The framework can be applied to any existing GNN model without re-training or making any assumptions. The paper evaluates the framework on real-world datasets and shows that it achieves effective and efficient certification, as well as debiasing benefits.

**strengths:**

* The paper addresses a novel and important problem of certifying the fairness of GNNs, which can enhance reliability while maintaining the fairness of GNNs in various applications.
* The authors introduce a novel and flexible framework that can certify the robustness of any GNN model to perturbation attacks by using a principled analysis and a plug-and-play design. The framework does not rely on any assumptions about the GNN structure or parameters and does not require re-training the GNNs.
* Extensive experiments and analysis are conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework in defending fairness-aware attacks.

**weaknesses:**

* The problem setting as well as the assumptions need further clarification in my opinion. 1) Why the authors choose to certify a classifier on top of an optimized GNN is unclear, given the existing works on robustness certification of GNNs on regular attacks mainly choose to directly target GNNs. 2) The difference between the attacking performance of GNNs and the fairness of GNNs should be clarified, especially how this difference affects the assumptions and theoretical results. It seems like the certification approach could also be applied without considering the binary sensitive attribute. 3) How the main theoretical findings differ from existing works on robustness certification of GNNs on regular attacks could be explicitly discussed for ease of understanding.

* Some recent works tackling graph robustness are not covered in the related works, especially spectral-based methods such as [1-4]. 
 

* For experiments, do there exist other defense methods that also defend the fairness-aware attack on graphs that could be included as baselines?

* Minor: in Theorem 4, should “Certified Defense Budget for Attribute Perturbations” be “Certified Defense Budget for Structure Perturbations”?

**summary:**

This paper aims to investigate the certified defense in group fairness based on randomized smoothing. Specifically, the method of analyzing certified robustness with randomized smoothing is transferred to the analysis on fairness. In their analysis the problem is reformulated for the fairness problem.

**strengths:**

1. The attempt to build certified fairness defense is interesting. There is an interesting direction to further investigate.
2. The presentation is quite clear and easy to follow.

**weaknesses:**

1. The technical contribution of this paper is a bit weak in that they mostly followed [1]. The main contributions merely lie in reframing the problems into the robustness on fairness.
2. There is a major concern about how the proposed method can improve the fairness of graph neural networks. In particular, according to the theorem 1, the smoothed version of the classifier can only guarantee the discrimination wouldn't change a lot after any perturbations. However, if the given GNN is biased, how can this method improve the fairness? Can you clarify how the proposed method can improve the fairness of models?
3. More analysis on the certified robustness in fairness should be given.

We sincerely appreciate the time and efforts you've dedicated to reviewing and providing invaluable feedback to enhance the quality of this paper. We provide a point-to-point reply below for the mentioned concerns and questions.

>  **Reviewer**: The technical contribution of this paper is a bit weak in that they mostly followed [1]. The main contributions merely lie in reframing the problems into the robustness on fairness.

**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for bringing up [1]. However, we would like to clarify that the technical novelty of our work significantly differs from the contribution of [1]. Specifically, the contribution of [1] mainly lies in utilizing Gaussian to certify a specific predicted label with continuous input. However, such an approach cannot be directly used to tackle the problem studied in our paper. Reasons include: (1) the certification achieved by [1] **is not able to handle discrete input**; (2) the certification achieved by [1] **fails to achieve joint certification on a span over multiple input data modalities**; and (3) the certification achieved by [1] focuses on a specific data point **instead of the property of a group of data points**.  

Therefore, we argue that other than formulating a novel research problem, the novelty of our work also lies in: (1) we proposed a strategy to properly handle the smoothing over graph topology; (2) we take the first step to achieve joint certification over the span of continuous and discrete data modalities (i.e., node attributes and graph topology), which is **particularly essential** for certifying Graph Neural Networks due to its natural multi-modality input; and (3) we establish a framework ELEGANT to achieve the certification of the property of a group of data points with the proposed techniques above.  

In fact, we note that the only connection between our work and [1] is that the same type of noise (i.e., Gaussian noise) is adopted to smooth the input data in the continuous domain (i.e., node attributes). We would like to argue that Gaussian noise is widely used in research based on randomized smoothing, and thus using Gaussian noise to smooth the continuous input data should not be considered to undermine the novelty.

However, if the given GNN is biased, how can this method improve the fairness? Can you clarify how the proposed method can improve the fairness of models?

**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We would like to clarify that improving fairness is a byproduct of ELEGANT, and our main focus is to achieve certification over the fairness level of the prediction results. However, as suggested, we provide a detailed discussion about why the fairness performance can be significantly improved in ELEGANT below.  

As mentioned in Section 3.4, the proposed strategy to obtain the output predictions in ELEGANT is to select the fairest result among the output set $\hat{\mathcal{Y}}'$. Such a strategy provides a large enough probability to achieve certification in light of Proposition 1. At the same time, we point out that such a strategy also helps to significantly improve fairness since outputs with a high level of bias are excluded.  As suggested, we also added the detailed discussion above in Appendix B.9 of our submission. We thank the reviewer again for the key question.

>  **Reviewer**: More analysis on the certified robustness in fairness should be given.

**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for the feedback. We have provided a comprehensive analysis of the certified robustness of fairness in our paper. To help understand the main analysis presented in this paper, we provide a brief summary regarding each lemma, theorem, and proposition presented in this paper.

*Theorem 1. (Certified Fairness Defense for Node Attributes)*: This theorem gives a way to compute the perturbation-invariant budget (i.e., the budget within which the fairness level will not reduce under a certain threshold) of node attributes. However, since we consider both input data modalities could be attacked, we still need to extend the analysis over the span of node attributes and graph topology (see Theorem 4).  

*Theorem 2. (Certified Defense Budget for Structure Perturbations)*: This theorem formulates an optimization problem, whose solution is the perturbation-invariant budget (i.e., the budget within which the fairness level will not reduce under a certain threshold) of graph topology under the smoothed node attributes. However, to solve this optimization problem, we need to explicitly compute $\underline{P_{\tilde{g}_{\boldsymbol{X}}=1}}$ (see Theorem 3).  

*Theorem 3. (Positive Probability Lower Bound)*: This theorem provides a way to explicitly compute $\underline{P_{\tilde{g}_{\boldsymbol{X}}=1}}$, which directly enables us to solve the optimization problem in Theorem 2.  

*Theorem 4. (Certified Defense Budget over Node Attributes)*: This theorem is built upon Theorem 1 and provides a way to explicitly compute the perturbation-invariant budget of node attributes over the span of node attributes and graph topology.  

*Lemma 1. (Perturbation-Invariant Budgets Existence)*: This lemma claims the existence and tractability of the perturbation-invariant budgets on both data modalities, which is further detailed by Theorem 2 and Theorem 4.  

*Lemma 2. (Positive Probability Bound Under Noises)*: This lemma claims the existence and tractability of $\underline{P_{\tilde{g}_{\boldsymbol{X}}=1}}$, which is further detailed by Theorem 3.  

*Proposition 1. (Probabilistic Guarantee for the Fairness Level of Node Classification)*: This proposition provides a neat probabilistic theoretical guarantee — we have a probability that is large enough to successfully achieve certified defense on fairness (i.e., obtaining results with a bias level lower than the given threshold).      

We hope the summary above helps address your concern. We have added the corresponding discussion in Appendix A.9 of our paper. We are also eager to learn more about your concern regarding any analysis that can be further clarified/added.

>  **Reviewer**: 1) Why the authors choose to certify a classifier on top of an optimized GNN is unclear, given the existing works on robustness certification of GNNs on regular attacks mainly choose to directly target GNNs.

**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We present the reason to *certify a classifier on top of an optimized GNN* instead of *directly targeting at certifying a GNN model against regular attacks* below.  

We note that the rationale of certified defense is to provably maintain the classification results against attacks. Under this context, most existing works on certifying an existing deep learning model focus on certifying a specific predicted label over a given data point. Here, the prediction results to be certified are classification results. Correspondingly, these works are able to directly certify the model itself.  

However, the strategy above is not feasible in our studied problem. This is because we seek to certify the level of fairness of a group of nodes. The value of such a group-level property cannot be directly considered as a classification result, and thus they are not feasible to be directly certified. Therefore, we proposed to first formulate a classifier on top of an optimized GNN. As such, achieving certification becomes feasible. In fact, this also serves as one of the contributions of our work.  

Accordingly, we have added a detailed discussion in Appendix C.1 in our paper. We thank the reviewer again for the constructive feedback.

---

>  **Reviewer**: 2) The difference between the attacking performance of GNNs and the fairness of GNNs should be clarified, especially how this difference affects the assumptions and theoretical results. It seems like the certification approach could also be applied without considering the binary sensitive attribute.

**Authors**: We agree with the reviewer that clarifying the difference between the attacking performance of GNNs and the fairness of GNNs would help the reader have a deeper understanding. We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. As suggested, we provide a detailed discussion about *(1) the difference between the attacking performance of GNNs and the fairness of GNNs* and *(2) applying the certification approach without considering the binary sensitive attribute* below.  

**(1) What is the difference between the attacking performance of GNNs and the fairness of GNNs?**  

In traditional attacks over the performance of GNNs, the objective of the attacker is simply formulated as having false predictions on as many nodes as possible, such that the overall performance is jeopardized. However, in attacks over the fairness of GNNs, whether the goal of the attacker can be achieved is jointly determined by the GNN predictions over all nodes. Such node-level dependency in achieving the attacking goal makes the defense over fairness attacks more difficult, since the defense cannot be directly performed at the node level but at the model level instead. Correspondingly, this necessitates (1) constructing an additional classifier as discussed in the previous reply, and (2) additional theoretical analysis over the constructed classifier as in Theorem 1, 2, and 3 to achieve certification.  

**(2) Can we apply the certification approach without considering the binary sensitive attribute?**  

Yes. In this work, we utilize the most widely studied setting to assume the sensitive attributes are binary. However, our certification approach is not designed to be tailored to the sensitive attributes. Therefore, our approach can be easily extended to scenarios where the sensitive attributes are multi-class and continuous by adopting the corresponding fairness metric as the function $\pi(\cdot)$ in Definition 1.

We have e also added a more detailed discussion in Appendix C.2 and C.3 of our paper accordingly. We thank the reviewer again for the great questions.

>  **Reviewer**: 3) How the main theoretical findings differ from existing works on robustness certification of GNNs on regular attacks could be explicitly discussed for ease of understanding.

**Authors**:  We agree with the reviewer that providing more clues on how the main theoretical findings differ from existing works on robustness certification of GNNs on regular attacks would be beneficial for the presentation of our paper. Correspondingly, we provide the discussion below.  

Most existing works for robustness certification (e.g., [1, 2, 3]) can only defend against attacks on either node attributes or graph structure. Due to the multi-modal input data of GNNs, existing works usually fail to handle the attacks over node attributes and graph structure at the same time. However, ELEGANT is able to defend against attacks over both data modalities. This necessitates using both continuous and discrete noises for smoothing and the analysis for joint certification in the span of the two input data modalities (as shown in Figure 1). We have also added the discussion above in Appendix C.4 of our submission, and we thank the reviewer again for pointing this out.

>  **Reviewer**: Some recent works tackling graph robustness are not covered in the related works, especially spectral-based methods such as [1-4].

**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out, and we have added a detailed discussion about the works provided in our appendix. In addition, we would like to elaborate on the reasons why we originally did not involve them below. First, the attacking scenario studied in this paper is **model evasion attack**. Therefore, we originally did not involve [1] and [3] **since they study a different problem of data poisoning attack**. In addition, the approach proposed in this paper **does not have any overlap with the spectral analysis of GNNs**, and thus the proposed approach can be generalized to both spatial and spectral GNNs. Therefore, we originally did not involve [2] and [4] since they solely focus on the spectral analysis of spectral GNNs.  We thank the reviewer again for pointing this out, and adding them to our submission has made the discussion in this paper more comprehensive.  

---

>  **Reviewer**: For experiments, do there exist other defense methods that also defend the fairness-aware attack on graphs that could be included as baselines?

**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We would like to clarify that the study on the fairness attack and defense over GNNs remains at an early stage. To the best of our knowledge, this paper serves as the first work studying the problem of fairness defense for GNNs. Therefore, **there is no other existing method** that defends the fairness-aware attack on graphs. Such an initial step presented in this paper also makes this research problem particularly interesting to us.  

---

>  **Reviewer**: Minor: in Theorem 4, should “Certified Defense Budget for Attribute Perturbations” be “Certified Defense Budget for Structure Perturbations”?

**Authors**: We agree with the reviewer that the title of Theorem 4 could be confusing for the readers. In fact, Theorem 4 presents the computation of the perturbation budget over the node attributes under binary noise on the graph structure. To avoid potential confusion, we have changed its name to “Certified Defense Budget over Node Attributes”. We thank the reviewer for pointing this out.

I could not follow how the proposed scheme can be used to certify fairness metrics requiring the ground-truth label information (e.g., equal opportunity) over the test set. The paper claims that equal opportunity is a metric for which they can provide verification.

**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We agree with the reviewer that the proposed model is more suitable for achieving certification over the metrics that do not require ground-truth labels. However, for metrics that require ground-truth labels, we are able to utilize a surrogate model (here we utilize GCN) to obtain predicted labels for the test nodes. We agree with the reviewer that the discussion associated with this part could be improved for better clarification. We have revised Section 4.3 accordingly, and we thank the reviewer again for the constructive feedback.

>  **Reviewer**: There are already existing works searching over such augmentations for bias mitigation [1, 2, 3], which utilize theoretical findings and systematic designs to automatize augmentation designs. Thus, the bias mitigation part of this work is not of sufficient contribution (Figure 2 would be fairer, if fairness-aware methods' results are obtained over the same set of corrupted graphs used for ELEGANT).

We note that improving fairness is a byproduct of ELEGANT, and our main focus is to achieve certification over the fairness level of the GNN prediction results.  Specifically, we emphasize that the main contribution of this paper lies in establishing an approach for the joint certification over the span of both continuous and discrete input graph data. To the best of our knowledge, this serves as the first work that (1) achieves certified defense for the fairness of GNNs and (2) achieves joint certification against attacks on both node attributes and graph topology.

The proposed approach is computationally costly, and lacks an inventive approach.

**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for the constructive feedback. We provide the clarification of the (1) time complexity analysis and (2) the novelty of the proposed approach below.  

**(1) Time complexity analysis.**  

*Theoretical*: The time complexity is theoretically linear w.r.t. the total number of the random perturbations $N$, i.e. $\mathcal{O}(N)$. In our experiments, we perform 30,000 random perturbations over the span of node attributes and graph structure. We note that the running time is always acceptable even if $N$ is large, since the certification process does not require GNN re-training (which is the most costly procedure throughout this process). In addition, all runnings based on these random perturbations do not rely on the prediction results from each other. Hence they can be paralleled altogether theoretically, which will further reduce the running time.  

*Experimental*: We also perform a study of running time. Specifically, we compare the running time of a successful certification under 30,000 random noise samples and a regular training-inference cycle with vanilla GCN in Appendix B.8. We observe that (1) although ELEGANT improves the computational cost compared with the vanilla GNN backbones, the running time remains acceptable; and (2) ELEGANT has less running time growth rate on larger datasets. For example, E-SAGE has around 10x running time on German Credit (a smaller dataset) while only around 4x on Credit Default (a larger dataset) compared to vanilla SAGE. Hence we argue that ELEGANT bears a high level of usability in terms of complexity and running time.  

**(2) The novelty of the proposed approach.**  

We argue that utilizing the commonly adopted noise to achieve randomized smoothing does not jeopardize the novelty of this paper, since the novelty of this paper does not lie in the selection of noise. Instead, this paper established an approach for the joint certification over the span of both continuous and discrete input data, which particularly fits the need of Graph Neural Networks. In fact, this serves as the first work that (1) achieves certified defense for the fairness of GNNs and (2) achieves joint certification against attacks on both node attributes and graph topology to the best of our knowledge.

>  **Reviewer**: Can you additionally provide the results for fairness-aware baselines over the same corrupted graphs as ELEGANT uses for the results in Figure 2? Accordingly, I suggest re-framing the discussion about bias mitigation in the paper.

**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. As suggested, we provide additional results for fairness-aware baselines (including GCN, NIFTY, and FairGNN) over the same corrupted graphs as ELEGANT uses for the results in Figure 2 below. We note that all numerical values in Figure 2 are in a log scale for better visualization purposes. We have also included the corresponding results in Appendix B.10.

We thank the reviewer for the suggestion about re-framing the discussion about bias mitigation. We have revised Section 4.2 accordingly to present a better discussion about bias mitigation.

**comment:**

We sincerely appreciate the time and efforts you've dedicated to reviewing and providing invaluable feedback to enhance the quality of this paper. We provide a point-to-point reply below for the mentioned concerns and questions.

---

>  **Reviewer**: The paper ignores the existence of collective certificates (see e.g. [4] and follow up work). Since for such collective certificates the predictions of all nodes are simultaneously certified this automatically implies a certificate on any function of those predictions and in particular any fairness metric. Therefore, a comparison with collective certificates is warranted.

**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We note that to the best of our knowledge, there is **no existing work** where a joint certification for GNNs can be achieved over both continuous node attributes and discrete graph topology. In fact, the problem studied in this paper is novel, and there is neither any straightforward certification approach that can be directly adopted to handle the problem studied in this paper. We are not sure which existing literature the reviewer is referring to by [4] since no corresponding reference is provided. However, we are eager to engage in further discussion to learn about whether the concern has been addressed by the discussion above and how we are still expected to extend any existing approach to serve as baselines. We thank the reviewer again for the key suggestions.  

---

>  **Reviewer**: As a minor point: While the authors are the first to consider certficates w.r.t. both features and structure when the features are continious, joint certificates for discrete features have already been studuied in [3]. 

**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. However, we note that **(1) the randomized smoothing technique adopted in [3] is different from the proposed randomized smoothing approach on the graph topology in our paper** and **(2) the techniques in [3] tackle a different problem** from our paper. We elaborate on more details below.  

**The techniques in [3] are different from our paper.** Although both randomized smoothing approaches are able to handle binary data, we note that the randomized smoothing approach proposed in [3] is *data-dependent*. However, the proposed randomized smoothing approach in our paper is *data-independent*. We note that in practice, a data-independent approach enables practitioners to pre-generate noises, which significantly improves usability.

**The studied problem in [3] is different from our paper.** Although the authors claimed to achieve a joint certificate for graph topology and node attributes in [3], all node attributes are assumed to be binary, which can only be applied to cases where these attributes are constructed as bag-of-words representations (as mentioned in the second last paragraph in the Introduction of [3]). However, in our work, we follow a more realistic setting where only graph topology is assumed to be binary while node attributes are considered as continuous. This makes the problem **more difficult to handle**, since different strategies should be adopted for different data modalities. In summary, compared with [3], the problem studied in this paper is more realistic and more suitable for GNNs.  

Based on the discussion above, we believe the contribution of this paper is novel and particularly interesting to the researchers working in this area. We have also added a detailed discussion about the works pointed out by the reviewer in Appendix C.6. We thank the reviewer again for the suggestion.

---

>  **Reviewer**: As a minor point: The authors claim that there is a high computational cost of calculating $\epsilon_{\textbf{A}}$. While the cost is higher compared to Gaussian smoothing it is definitely not prohibitively high since as shown by [3] the certificate can be computed in linear time w.r.t. the certified radius, and thus the maximum certified radius can be also efficiently computed.

**Authors**: We agree with the reviewer that the computational cost of calculating $\epsilon_{\textbf{A}}$ is not prohibitively high. **We need to clarify a misunderstanding below**.   

In our paper, by claiming that the computational cost of calculating $\epsilon_{\textbf{A}}$ is high (as in Appendix B.6), we only aim to claim the computational cost of calculating $\epsilon_{\textbf{A}}$ is **higher than that of Gaussian smoothing**, instead of claiming it to be prohibitively high. By this claim, we revealed the reason why we adopt certification on node attributes as the inner certification: since the certified radius of the inner certification needs to be computed more times than the outer certification in our proposed method, it is reasonable to utilize the one with a lower computational cost for the certified radius as the inner certification.

>  **Reviewer**: In addition to the above I have strong doubts in the correctness of Proposition 1 and the discussion in the preceeding "Obtaining Fair Classification Result" paragraph. 

**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. However, there seems to be a misunderstanding that Proposition 1 only holds when the output prediction corresponding to each specific node is certified separately. We note that **Proposition 1 does not rely on certification over any specific prediction**, and this is achieved by formulating a classifier on top of an optimized GNN model (as in Definition 3).  

Specifically, in traditional works focusing on certification, most existing works simply certify an existing deep learning model by certifying a specific predicted label over a given data point. Here, the prediction results to be certified are classification results. Correspondingly, these works are able to directly certify the model itself. However, the strategy above is not feasible in our studied problem. This is because we seek to certify the level of fairness of a group of nodes. The value of such a group-level property cannot be directly considered as a classification result, and thus they are not feasible to be directly certified. Therefore, we proposed to first formulate a classifier on top of an optimized GNN. As such, achieving certification becomes feasible without certifying any specific classification result of the GNN model.  

In fact, we note that one of the major differences between our work and other existing works on certification is that most existing works aim to achieve certification over a specific prediction, while our work aims to achieve certification over the property (i.e., the level of fairness) of a set of predictions. We thank the reviewer again for pointing this out.

---

>  **Reviewer**: Moreover, it seems that the guarantee in Proposition 1 only applies to perturbations w.r.t. the features since the authors take the best (smallest) value over all structure perturbations. If this is the case this should be clearly mentioned, if this is not the case it is not clear at all why the certificate holds when selecting the argmin as proposed.

**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We would like to clarify a misunderstanding here: **Proposition 1 holds for the joint certification over node attributes and graph topology**. We provide detailed proof in Appendix A.8. We thank the reviewer for pointing this out, and we have added additional discussion to Appendix B.9 of our submission to avoid confusion.

>  **Reviewer**: Another weakness is the evaluation. While the 3 datasets (German Credit, Recidivism, Credit Defaulter) are often used in the fairness literature they are not ideal since the graph structure is not given but derived from the features (see NIFTY (Agarwal et al., 2021)). This means that there is a high correlation between the features and the structure and the redundancy in information leads to overly optimistic results. The two Pokec datasets which are also often used in the fairness literature would be more suitable.

**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We agree with the reviewer that the graph structure derived from node features may lead to a high correlation between the features and the structure. However, such correlation could also happen in various real-world attributed graph datasets, and **such correlation does not influence the effectiveness of the proposed method**.  

To further validate the performance of the proposed method, as suggested, we also perform experiments with the same commonly used popular GNN backbone models (as Section 4.2) on the suggested two Pokec datasets, namely Pokec-z and Pokec-n. We present the experimental results below, where all numerical numbers are in percentage. We observe that (1) the GNNs equipped with ELEGANT achieve comparable node classification accuracy; (2) the GNNs equipped with ELEGANT achieve consistently lower levels of bias; and (3) the values of the Fairness Certification Rate (FCR) for all GNNs equipped with ELEGANT exceed 90%, exhibiting satisfying usability. All three observations are consistent with the experimental results and the corresponding discussion presented in Section 4.2. Therefore, we argue that the effectiveness of the proposed approach is not determined by the dataset and is well generalizable over different graph datasets.  

We thank the reviewer again for bringing this up so we can make our evaluation more comprehensive. We have included the experimental results and the corresponding discussion in Appendix C.7.

>  **Reviewer**: Since every entry is flipped with the same probability $1 - \beta$ even for very small values of $1 - \beta$ we will introduced many new ones in the adjacency matrix destroying the sparsity which makes scaling to larger graphs more difficult.

**Authors**: We agree with the reviewer that if the perturbation is directly performed over the whole graph, scaling to larger graphs would be difficult. However, we note that **the proposed approach can be easily extended to the batch training case**, which has been widely adopted by existing scalable GNNs. Specifically, a commonly adopted batch training strategy of scalable GNNs is to only input a node and its surrounding subgraph into the GNN, since the prediction of GNNs only depends on the information of the node itself and its multi-hop neighbors, and the number of hops is determined by the layer number of GNNs. Since the approach proposed in our paper aligns with the basic pipeline of GNNs, the perturbation can also be performed for each specific batch of nodes. In this case, all theoretical analyses in this paper still hold, since they also do not rely on the assumption of non-batch training. **Therefore, we would like to argue that the proposed approach can be easily scaled to large graphs.**  We thank the reviewer for pointing this out, and we have added the corresponding discussion in Appendix C.8.

>  **Reviewer**: Finally, I think the motivation behind the Fairness Certification Rate (FCR) metric is questionable. A more informative metric would be e.g. the largest certified threshold $\eta$ for different bugets.

**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for the suggestions. We note that the reason for adopting the Fairness Certification Rate (FCR) as the corresponding metric is that such a metric serves as a close extension of the metric of certified accuracy, which has been widely adopted in existing certified defense literature [1, 2]. The corresponding intuition is to measure the ratio of outputs that are both (1) true and (2) successfully certified. **Hence, we argue that adopting FCR maintains the evaluation consistency between this work and other existing works.**  

In addition, we agree with the reviewer that the largest certified threshold $\eta$ for different budgets would also be a meaningful metric. Nevertheless, for any given budget, the corresponding smoothed classifier $\tilde{g}_{\textbf{A},\textbf{X}}$ is intractable. As a result, in our studied problem, it is computationally impractical to compute the corresponding $\eta$  in practice.

>  **Reviewer**: Assuming that only the features are perturbed which final vector of test predictions is returned and why exactly is this vector certified?

**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for the question. In our understanding, this question is about a modification of the proposed method: if we only apply randomized smoothing to node attributes and only achieve certification over node attributes, then how to obtain the corresponding output with fairness certification on node attributes?

We note that our method naturally extends to the case mentioned above. Specifically, by setting $\beta = 1.0$ (i.e., no noise is added to the graph topology), Theorem 1 and Lemma 1 remain hold, since the value of $\beta$ falls in the assumption of $0.5 < \beta \leq 1.0$ (when $\beta = 1.0$ , the $\epsilon_{\textbf{A}}$ in Lemma 1 will then be 0). Correspondingly, the size of the set of $\tilde{\epsilon}_{\textbf{X}}$ presented in Theorem 4 will be one, where such a value is directly computed from Theorem 1. Accordingly, only one output will be involved in the set of $\hat{\mathcal{Y}}'$ , and such output will be returned as the final output. In this process, since the assumption over $\beta$ still holds, all theoretical analysis also remains hold. According to Theorem 1 and Lemma 1, we have that the fairness certification corresponding to such an output is certified. We thank the reviewer for pointing this out, and we have also revised the discussion in Section 3.3 to avoid potential misunderstanding.  

---

>  **Reviewer**: Does Proposition 1 apply to both feature and structure perturbations?

**Authors**: Yes. We note that **Proposition 1 holds for the joint certification over node attributes and graph topology**. We provide detailed proof in Appendix A.8. We thank the reviewer for pointing this out, and we have added further discussion to Appendix B.9 of our submission.

>  **Reviewer**: How exactly are Theorems 1, 2 and 3 different from existing results (See weaknesses)?

**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for the question. We elaborated on their differences below.  

**Difference between Theorem 1 and Existing Results**: The mentioned reference [1] presents the most similar theoretical results compared with Theorem 1. However, the certification achieved in the mentioned reference [1] is directly achieved over the classification model itself, while the certification achieved by Theorems 1 is over a constructed classifier. We argue that such an extension is not obvious. Therefore, comprehensive theoretical analysis is performed in our paper. 

**Difference between Theorems 2 and 3 and Existing Results**: We note that Theorems 2 and 3 are established over the joint certification for (continuous) node attributes and (discrete) graph topology. To the best of our knowledge, there is **no existing work** where a joint certification for GNNs can be achieved over both continuous node attributes and discrete graph topology (also see the 1st reply above). In fact, the problem studied in this paper is novel, and there is neither any straightforward certification approach that can be directly adopted to handle the problem studied in this paper.  

---

>  **Reviewer**: How does the approach compare to collective certificate (w.r.t. only structure perturbations for example)?

**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for the question. We note that compared with existing works on collective certification (especially those only focused on the binary perturbations suitable for graph structures, e.g., [1]), our paper (1) **utilizes a different randomized smoothing technique** and (2) **first achieves joint certification over the continuous and discrete span of the two input data modalities**. Specifically, we take the comparison between [1] and our paper as an example. First, although both the approach proposed by our paper and that in [1] are able to handle binary data, we note that the randomized smoothing approach proposed in [1] is *data-dependent*. However, the proposed randomized smoothing approach in our paper is *data-independent*. We note that in practice, a data-independent approach enables practitioners to pre-generate noises, which significantly improves usability. Second, although the authors claimed to achieve a joint certificate for graph topology and node attributes in [1], all node attributes are assumed to be binary, which can only be applied to cases where these attributes are constructed as bag-of-words representations (as mentioned in the second last paragraph in the Introduction of [1]). However, in our work, we follow a more realistic setting where only graph topology is assumed to be binary while node attributes are considered continuous. This makes the problem more difficult to handle since different strategies should be adopted for different data modalities.   

In summary, compared with [1], the problem studied in this paper is more realistic and more suitable for GNNs, and such a problem is tackled with a different technical approach. We have also added a detailed discussion about the works pointed out by the reviewer in Appendix C.6. We thank the reviewer again for the suggestion.

Thank you for the comprehensive reply. I still have a few unresolved questions.

By collective certificate I was refering to certificates such as [4] and [5] that jointly certify multiple nodes at once. Collective does not refer to structure + attribute. Appologies for the missing reference [4] in my original review. My question "How does the approach compare to collective certificate (w.r.t. only structure perturbations for example)?" still stands.

I understand that Proposition 1 does not rely on certification over any specific prediction. This is preceisly the issue that I have. As you say, essentially you certify a classifier on top of an optimized GNN. However, at the end of the day, when the model is deployed, you need to make and commit to some actual predictions for each node. These predictions will have some level of fairness. Whatever this level of fairness is for these "final" predictions it is not the same level which is certified by Proposition 1. If you agree, this is a major weakness. If you disagree please clearly specify what are the actual final predictins, and whether they have a certified fairness level or not, and if they do how exactly does this follow from Propostion 1.

As another point: [1] introduce both a binary and a discrete certificate and the joint (attribute + structure) can be binary+binary or discrete+binary (discrete for features + binary for structure). You can discreteize any continious data to arbitrary precision. Moreover, an $l_0$ certificate implies a corresponding $l_2$ ceritificate by the properties of norms so it can be directly compared to your apporach.

Finally, I thinik the benefit of data-dependent noise heavily outweighs any benefit that data-independent approach enables. Pre-generating noises is only slighlty helpful since it is extremely cheap to sample binary vectors.

Appologies for the missing reference [4] in my original review. My question "How does the approach compare to collective certificate (w.r.t. only structure perturbations for example)?" still stands.

**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We would like to note that [4] and [5] **study a different problem** compared with the problem in our paper, and thus the techniques proposed in [4] and [5] **cannot be adopted** to handle the problem studied in our paper.  

Specifically, both the problems of certification studied in [4] and [5] still aim to realize a certification to *keep as many predictions unchanged as possible* under attacks. Correspondingly, the collective certification in both works is based on per-prediction certificates (e.g., the discussion in Section 3 of [4]). However, we study the problem of certifying the group-level fairness in our paper, and thus the strategy cannot be established based on per-prediction certificates. For example, maintaining the fairness level of prediction does not necessarily require any specific prediction to be unchanged under attacks.  

In summary, the problem studied in [4] and [5] relies on the analysis at the level of per-prediction, while the problem studied in our paper cannot be handled by the per-prediction level analysis.

>  **Reviewer**: These predictions will have some level of fairness. Whatever this level of fairness is for these "final" predictions it is not the same level which is certified by Proposition 1. If you agree, this is a major weakness. If you disagree please clearly specify what are the actual final predictins, and whether they have a certified fairness level or not, and if they do how exactly does this follow from Propostion 1.

**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and we are excited to see the deep understanding you have shown to our work. First, we need to clarify a misunderstanding: these "final" predictions may be not at the same level that is certified by Theorem 2 and Theorem 4 instead of Proposition 1. Second, we note that such a problem necessitates proposing Proposition 1, which aims to provide a guarantee that **even if these "final" predictions may not be successfully certified, the probability of failing to certify these "final" predictions is small enough** (the probability exponentially decays w.r.t. the cardinality of the set $\hat{\mathcal{Y}}'$). This ensures the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in practice.

>  **Reviewer**: [1] introduce both a binary and a discrete certificate and the joint (attribute + structure) can be binary+binary or discrete+binary (discrete for features + binary for structure). You can discreteize any continious data to arbitrary precision. Moreover, an $l_0$ certificate implies a corresponding  $l_0$ ceritificate by the properties of norms so it can be directly compared to your apporach.

**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We agree with the reviewer that one can discretize any continuous data to arbitrary precision. However, such a discretization bears two main disadvantages.   

First, in practice, most GNNs are trained with continuous input. To achieve certification with such a discretization-based strategy, **all these GNNs are required to be re-trained** to match the dimensionality after feature discretization, bringing additional computational costs. In practice, such additional computational costs could be unacceptably high if the scale of the training data or the model is large. However, the approach proposed in our paper can be directly utilized to certify these **optimized GNNs without any additional re-training or modifications**.  

Second, we usually need a large number of bits to represent continuous node features with high precision. However, the number of bits directly determines the total number of learnable parameters in GNNs, e.g., the number of node features determines the hidden dimension of the first MLP layer in GNNs. Involving a large number of learnable parameters also makes such a discretization-based strategy infeasible in practice due to **its high computational complexity**.

In addition, to ensure that the whole pipeline is practical, we will also have to seek a balance between the precision and the extra computational cost. Based on the disadvantages above, we argue that the discretization-based strategy is not directly compared to the approach proposed in our paper.  

---

>  **Reviewer**: Finally, I thinik the benefit of data-dependent noise heavily outweighs any benefit that data-independent approach enables. Pre-generating noises is only slighlty helpful since it is extremely cheap to sample binary vectors.

**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We agree with the reviewer that being able to pre-generate noise does not serve as a main advantage of the proposed approach in our paper. In fact, the main advantage of the proposed approach lies in being able to certify the group-level fairness in the span of both discrete and continuous input, which is particularly suitable for GNNs working on attributed graphs. Based on the discussion above, existing works using data-dependent noise to achieve certification (e.g., [1]) cannot be directly adopted to handle the studied problem in our paper.

**comment:**

Thank you for the response. Appologies if I am misunderstanding something, but for me it's still not clear what exactly are the final predictions and why Propostion 1 holds.

To simplify the discussion assume that you are only concerned with attribute perturbations, then you can apply Theorem 1 to 
certify the output of the bias indicator function. This much is clear. 

However, this certificate only says that the **smoothed** bias function as defined in Eq. 1 has the same output in the worst case. It does not say anything about any particular random sample, i.e. we cannot conclude anything about a single sample $g(f_\theta, A, X + \gamma_X(\cdot), \eta, V_{tst})$.

Now given Theorem 1 what is the final vector of predictions for each node, and what is the certified fairness level for this vector?

Author Response to Reviewer wEZx

**comment:**

Thanks for your valuable feedback. We would like to clarify your last concern below.  

First, we assume that we are given a reasonable $\eta$ as the threshold of the output bias level to be certified, where the bias level of the output of the GNN model should be less or equal to $\eta$. In other words, the output of the bias indicator function (defined in Def. 1) should be 1 before the randomized smoothing.  

Then, given the mentioned situation, we are able to certify the output of the smoothed bias function (defined in Def. 2) has the same output (i.e., having an output of 1) in the worst case. Note that the output of the smoothed bias function is directly calculated from the output of the GNN model. Consider the bias level of the output predictions associated with the smoothed bias function being 1 under the random noise as a random variable. Then the probability of such a random variable being less or equal to $\eta$ should be larger than 0.5 according to the definition of the smoothed bias function in Def 2.  

The last step is to obtain the predictions for the test nodes. Since we have known that under the input noise, the output predictions of GNN will have a probability of at least 0.5 to be less biased than the threshold $\eta$. Denote we have a prediction sample set $\hat{\mathcal{Y}}'$ (as in Proposition 1) obtained from the Monte Carlo sampling, where each element in this set includes the output predictions for all test nodes. We then know each element in $\hat{\mathcal{Y}}'$ will have at least a probability of 0.5 to be less biased than the threshold $\eta$. Finally, we choose the least biased element in  $\hat{\mathcal{Y}}'$ (as the predictions for the test nodes), the chosen element will bear a probability that is small enough to be still more biased than $\eta$ (as stated in Proposition 1). This completes the certification in practice.  

We believe this addresses your last concern, and we hope that you could also consider raising your score. We thank you again for your constructive feedback and deep understanding of our paper.

**comment:**

Definition 2 is the **mean** of a random variable, and thus Theorem 1 certifeis that the **mean > 0.5**. Any particular sample from this random variable is either above or below the threshold so what do you mean by "output predictions of GNN will have a probability of at least 0.5 to be less biased than the threshold"?

To put it in other words, if you draw 100 samples from the variable, some of these will be $< \eta$, others will be $> \eta$ and Theorem 1 says that the average of these 100 must be $> 0.5$. Now if you take out of 100 samples the one that is the most fair, this one might be $< \eta$ or $> \eta$ but there is no way to know.  Is there any flaw with this logic?

**comment:**

Thanks for the prompt feedback.  

We would like to clarify a misunderstanding below, and we follow the example of drawing 100 samples. Theorem 1 certifies that **every time we draw a sample, it will bear a probability of larger than 0.5 to have a bias level smaller than $\eta$**. Therefore, the smoothed bias indicator function (in Eq. 1) can be certified to output 1, as this function returns **what most likely to happen**.  

Given the context above, if we choose the least biased sample from the 100 samples, it bears a probability of at most $0.5^{100}$ to be still more biased than $\eta$. Since this requires all 100 samples to be more biased than $\eta$, which has a small enough probability to happen.

It seems that the misunderstanding is associated with Theorem 1. To put it simply, Theorem 1 says that the random variable (i.e., the bias level of predictions) will always have a larger probability of being less biased than $\eta$. **We do not calculate or achieve certification over the mean of the bias level in this process.**

We hope this addresses your last concern.

You claim "every time we draw a sample, it will bear a probability of larger than 0.5 to have a bias level smaller than $\eta$."

What is this probability over? Once you have a sample there is no other random process on top whose outcome is $>0.5$. Or am I missing something?

Maybe we can approach my question from another angle. Think about an input graph $G=(A, X)$, now think about the infinitely many potential samples of the graph $[G(A, X+\epsilon_1), G(A, X+\epsilon_2), G(A, X+\epsilon_3), \dots]$ where each $\epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$. As you take each of these infinite samples and put them into a GNN the output is deterministic, either it's $<\eta$ or not. We can record this event as 1 or 0. So we have inifnitely many 1s and 0s indicating the event of whether we are below or above $\eta$. The average of these events is precisely defintion 2, and the average is guaranteed to be $>0.5$ for $X$ and any perturbed $X'$ in the radius. 

So if each of these individual infinitely many samples is deterministic, I don't understand what you mean by "it will bear a probability of larger than 0.5".

**comment:**

Thank you for your prompt feedback. We agree with the reviewer that it is not appropriate to describe a sample to bear a probability larger than 0.5. Instead, we should say the random variable (i.e., the bias level) bears a probability larger than 0.5 to be 1.

In the provided example, since the mean of 1s and 0s equals the probability of the random variable being 1, we agree with the reviewer that the mean is guaranteed to be $> 0.5$ according to Theorem 1. In other words, Theorem 1 guarantees that 1 will have a larger probability of appearing than 0. Correspondingly, Proposition 1 states that this event happens with a small enough probability: when we choose a sample that is the closest to having 1 by examining its corresponding bias level, it is still a 0.  

We hope this addresses your last concern.

I think we are now on the same page about this. Now, let's go back to propostion 1.

If I have a list of samples and their bias level:
1. $G(A, X+\epsilon_1) = \eta_1 = 0.02 < \eta$
2. $G(A, X+\epsilon_2) = \eta_2 = 0.01 < \eta$
3. $G(A, X+\epsilon_3) = \eta_2 = 0.04 < \eta$
4. $\dots$

And if you pick the best one out of these, which in the above example is the second row. Why can you conclude anything about the adversarial $X'$?

Since theorem 1 says mean of clean $[G(A, X+\epsilon_1), G(A, X+\epsilon_2), G(A, X+\epsilon_3), \dots] > 0.5$ implies that mean of adversarial $[G(A, X'+\epsilon_1), G(A, X'+\epsilon_2), G(A, X'+\epsilon_3), \dots] > 0.5$. But how can you conclude anything about a single particular adversarial X' that you get at test time?

**comment:**

Thank you for your prompt feedback. We clarify your concern below:  

First, we agree with the reviewer that Theorem 1 states the mean of clean $[G(A, X + \epsilon_1), G(A, X + \epsilon_2), G(A, X + \epsilon_3), ...] > 0.5$ implies that the mean of adversarial $[G(A, X' + \epsilon_1), G(A, X' + \epsilon_2), G(A, X' + \epsilon_3), ...] > 0.5$. In other words, even for adversarial $X'$, we will still have a larger probability of obtaining 1 than obtaining 0 for the random variable of the bias level indicator.  

Second, based on our first step, for any adversarial $X'$, we will also have a list of samples and their bias level:

1. $G(A, X' + \epsilon_1) = \eta_1 \leq \eta$
2. $G(A, X' + \epsilon_2) = \eta_2 \leq \eta$
3. $G(A, X' + \epsilon_3) = \eta_3 \leq \eta$
4. ...

Third, we pick the smallest $\eta_i$ from the list above. Notice that the first step has stated that we have a larger probability of obtaining an $\eta_i \leq \eta$. Therefore, Proposition 1 states that the smallest $\eta_i$ is highly unlikely to still be larger than $\eta$, since this implies that all $\eta_i$s are larger than $\eta$. This completes the certification analysis.  

To summarize, it seems that the misunderstanding happens by understanding Proposition 1 is derived based on the clean data (as the associated GNN input). We note that Proposition 1 is derived under the adversarial data (as the associated GNN input) to achieve certification. Of course, Proposition 1 still holds when clean data is used as the associated GNN input.  

We hope this addresses your last concern, and we sincerely thank you for your patience and deep understanding of our work. It is truly pleasant and valuable for us to have such an in-depth discussion about our work.

Do you then claim the following:

1. First, assume $mean( indicator(X'+\epsilon < \eta) ) > 0.5$ for all $X' \in ball(X)$.  Which as we agreed follows from Theorem 1.

2. Then do you claim $Prob[ minimum( \\{X' + \epsilon_i = \eta_i\\}_{i=1}^{100}) > \eta ] < 0.5^N$  for **all** $X' \in ball(X)$?

## Meta Review

### ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3771/Area_Chair_F4oQ — 2023-12-06T12:37:32.909000+00:00

**metareview:**

The paper proposes a novel framework for certifying the fairness of graph neural networks (GNNs) named ELEGANT. It's the first work for certificated fairness proof in GNNs. 

Strengths:

1. The paper tries to solve a novel and important problem of certifying the fairness of GNNs, which can enhance reliability while maintaining the fairness of GNNs in various applications.

2. The paper's proposed method is a plug-and-play one and does not rely on a specific GNN structure for their model. The empirical results also demonstrate their effectiveness.

Weaknesses:

1. As pointed out by many reviewers, the work mainly relies on former randomized smoothing papers and there also exist some randomized smoothing papers that deal with the optimization paper in the discrete space. Since the certified evaluation has already been done on discrete data and continuous data, I don't think combining them and proposing an evaluation on both discrete and continuous data is an important contribution. Thus, I think the paper's technical contribution to the certified fairness evaluation is not enough.

2. If their method can also effectively improve fairness, I think their contribution may be enough. However, as pointed out by some reviewers and authors, the proposed method is only for evaluation and can only slightly improve the models' robustness.

Due to the above reasons,  I think this work should be rejected. I think how to effectively improve GNN's fairness is more important and authors can work on improving their work in this direction.

**justification_for_why_not_higher_score:**

Its main contribution is about the certificate evaluation instead of improving the fairness.
